# dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles.
This is a collection of my personal dotfiles for my development environment.
It includes my vim, tmux, and zsh configurations.
Feel free to use them as a reference or copy them for your own use.

## Requirements

First, you will need to install chezmoi.
Information on how to do so can be found [here](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/).

There are also a few other dependencies that are required for the configurations to work properly.

- Git
- Zsh if you're on a Unix-like system

## Installation

To install:

```sh
chezmoi init https://github.com/BSFishy/dotfiles.git
```

To update to the latest version:

```sh
chezmoi update
```
